# GeeksforGeeks POTD Solutions Repository

This repository contains solutions to the *Problem of the Day (POTD)* challenges from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). The challenges cover a wide range of topics in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem-Solving.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each solution is stored in a separate folder.
- The folder name corresponds to the date of the challenge (e.g., 2024-08-28).
- Each folder contains:
  - The problem statement (if allowed).
  - The solution file(s) in the preferred programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java, etc.).
  - A brief explanation of the solution approach in a README.md inside each folder.
